# CUDA-Sankoff

CUDA-Sankoff is a tool that performs the optimal RNA structural alignment. We developed a CPU version (bin/sankoff) and a GPU version (bin/cuda\_sankoff).

## Getting Started

This software have been developed and tested on Linux, and it should work on all major distributions.

### Prerequisites

You need a modern C++ compiler. In Ubuntu, you can install it by:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libboost-dev
```

You also need the CUDA SDK. Check how to install it on the NVIDIA page:

https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

You also, need to Download Vienna RNA library, compile it in the folder 'ViennaRNA-2.3.3'. Check the instructions inside this folder.

### Compiling

To compile, you enter the "cuda\_sankoff" folder and type:

```
'make'
```

This works in all major Linux distributions and the 'bin/sankoff' and 'bin/cuda\_sankoff' binaries will be available.

## How to execute

Few examples:
```
#Easy test:
./bin/sankoff seqs/025.fasta

#Easy test:
./bin/cuda\_sankoff seqs/050.fasta
```

Check the 'cuda\_sankoff/seqs/' folder for other tests.

### More options

Usually the default options are the best to run. You can change and check more at:

```
./bin/sankoff -h
```
